                <p>SIGILLUM is a single-name artistic imprint publishing musical compositions and poetry <br>(with
                    selected
                    inheritances of the past) as artifacts and archiving the artist and his acts— <br>work that is
                    difficult
                    by
                    consequence, agonistic against time, in which there’s authority, <br>and is catalogued scholarly,
                    whose
                    only
                    measure is ripeness and the wonder wounding quality.</p>
                <p>We came to be after countless meetings and invaluable time spent with Yvaska (composer, <br>poet) in
                    Tokyo.
                    Our position we find is as the flaming cherub guarding against a great rock <br>in this extremely
                    weary
                    land. In times when commodity is branded as art, propaganda <br>taken for poetry, and an artist of
                    limited
                    to no means necessarily forced to take part as a <br>cog in the capitalist machinery of vanity and
                    corruption—we endeavor to be the gentle <br>robes that may to some extent sustain the artist in this
                    windy
                    desolation.</p>

                <p>Dear reader, we wish to be transparent but this opacity in our nature haunts us. We owe <br>you the
                    word,
                    which in our case is not the first, we accept our belatedness, and though it <br>be too frail to
                    sustain
                    the
                    flesh, bound by ordinance we still oblige you, dear reader, to <br>concede and grant us your company
                    for
                    a
                    brief while.</p>

                <p>Though naming it avails not, what we call Art is divine by nature and the poet a religion of <br>one.
                    The
                    true experience of a piece of art accordingly is a walk with god, a face to face, a <br>wonder
                    wounding,
                    a
                    breaking of the vessels. It does not redeem the fall, it leaves us bereft, <br>the walk ends and we
                    are
                    alone. And we can say that we do it much harm to survive the walk <br>it being so majestic. It
                    promises
                    us
                    nothing, it is beyond morality, it is out of times bounds, <br>it too will be when it will be. And
                    it
                    too is
                    full of jealousy robbing us of simpler pleasures <br>and filling us with general discontent. It is
                    not
                    for
                    the masses, it is a lonesome face to face that <br>is availed only to the solitary one.</p>

                <p>Why then must you, dear reader, put up with all the hideousness that this face to face instills
                    <br>in
                    one.
                    I cannot answer it, dear reader, I only knew myself long after I’d already fallen. <br>Time avails
                    not,
                    place avails not. The artist our only prophet and we concede ourselves to his <br>art out of
                    helplessness as
                    the face to face is too direct, immediate and sublime to be consoled <br>with reason and be denied.
                    Then,
                    dear reader, I could only entice you believing you are <br>already wonder wounded and to be of this
                    company
                    of the fallen.
                </p>

                <p>I still owe you, dear reader, why SIGILLUM? Take it as defiance against augury. There is <br>nothing
                    we
                    can
                    do for Shakespeare or Sebastian Bach, they encompass us and we occupy <br>a place vaguely small in
                    their
                    huge world. If we be the company of the fallen, let us be <br>three good friends and celebrate the
                    fall,
                    relish the exile and anticipate the upcoming walk. <br>Let us be as pilgrims who led by the holy
                    spirit
                    that
                    descends in Beethoven’s Benedictus <br>to the gates of heaven and let the gates open for us as in
                    Bach’s
                    Sanctus. So in act let <br>SIGILLUM be the pilgrimage besides one who is bearing the cross and we be
                    solemn
                    <br>when solemnity is demanded and make merry when tis’ proper.
                </p>

                <p>I would not be so harmful to speak about Yvaska, I can only say that I believe him of <br>potential
                    to be
                    the artist of our age and all ages. One must support such who brings god <br>down to us through his
                    art
                    and
                    in need of much support we are. I would ask of you, <br>dear reader, to know him through his art and
                    his
                    own
                    words then through mine which <br>are already in his shadow. Now, since I cannot stay though
                    hopelessly
                    it
                    is to be wished, <br>I must say my farewell. It was a pleasing thing to know you dear reader, I hope
                    you’ll <br>
